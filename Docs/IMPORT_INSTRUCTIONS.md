        ## Quick Import Instructions

1. In Unity: Create a new project or open your target project.
2. Copy `Assets` folder contents from the skeleton into your project's `Assets` directory.
3. In Unity Editor, create new scenes: `00_MainMenu`, `01_Lobby`, `99_TestArena` and save them under `Assets/Scenes`.
4. Create an empty GameObject named `GameManager` in each scene and attach `GameManager.cs`.
5. Create a Player prefab in `Assets/Prefabs/Player.prefab` and attach `PlayerController.cs`.
6. For networking choose Photon Fusion or Unity Netcode and integrate `MultiplayerManager.cs` accordingly.

Notes: This skeleton contains basic templates and comments to guide implementation.
