        # Bangla Battle 3D - Unity Project Skeleton

This is a starter skeleton for the **Bangla Battle 3D** Unity project.
        It contains folder layout and several minimal C# script templates to help you start the project quickly.


        ## How to use
1. Open Unity (2022.3 LTS or later recommended).
2. Create a new 3D project (URP recommended) or open an existing project.
3. Copy the contents of the `Assets` folder into your Unity project's `Assets` directory.
4. Open Unity and allow it to compile the scripts.
5. Create scenes (MainMenu, Lobby, TestArena) in `Assets/Scenes`.

## Included files
- Minimal C# scripts (GameManager, PlayerController, BotController, MultiplayerManager)
- Folder layout for assets, prefabs, audio, docs.

## Next steps (recommended)
- Add URP package, Addressables, and Networking package (Photon/Netcode) via Package Manager.
- Create placeholder scenes and attach scripts.
- Replace placeholder logic with gameplay code incrementally.

Good luck â€” let me know if you want me to populate a sample scene or expand any script.
